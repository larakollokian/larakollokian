### bonjour ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Lara and I'm a software developer based in Montreal, QC. I am currently part of the CMS and Shipping team at SSENSE. I was previously working on the Checkout Performance and Scale team at Shopify. I love working on and learning about software performance at scale, and am forever working on growing my skills ðŸ“–
